## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS for styling and layout
- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) methodology for class naming
- CSS modularization for maintainability
- Normalize.css for consistent cross-browser styling

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of:

- The BEM methodology and its advantages in scalable CSS architecture
- Modular CSS structure for better maintainability
- Using semantic HTML for improved accessibility
- Handling image `alt` text for screen readers

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to:

- Enhance the responsiveness by implementing more advanced media queries.
- Add ARIA attributes to further improve accessibility.
- Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [BEM Documentation](https://getbem.com/) - Helped me understand and implement BEM methodology.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - My go-to resource for HTML and CSS references.
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - Ensures a consistent baseline for styling across browsers.
